Kentucky Spider Classifier using Xresnet50

This repository uses fast AI to normalize the data and use smoothing algorithms to predict spiders in Kentucky.  Currently the accuracy I get with the 
algothithms used is a 38%. The goal is to keep building models to improve the predictions upon this dataset.  Currently we have our dataset unbalanced.
